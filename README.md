# 4-Way-Traffic-Light-Control-System
A 4-way traffic light system cycles through North-South Green, Yellow, and Red, then East-West Green, Yellow, and Red. It ensures no conflicting directions have Green lights simultaneously. Safety mechanisms, like an all-Red interval, prevent accidents, and the system is typically controlled by a microcontroller.
